# Chikorita-Style Resume (Static, GitHub Pages Ready)

A lightweight static resume site inspired by Reactive Resume's **Chikorita** theme. No build step. Just HTML/CSS/JS.

## Quick Start

1. **Edit resume data** in [`data/resume.json`](data/resume.json).
2. Open `index.html` locally to preview.
3. Commit & push this folder to your GitHub repo.
4. Enable **GitHub Pages** (Settings → Pages → Source: `main` branch, folder `/root`).
5. Visit your Pages URL.

> Use the **Download PDF** button to print/save a PDF (uses your browser's print-to-PDF).

## Customize

- Colors/spacing: tweak CSS variables at the top of `style.css`.
- Sections: edit HTML blocks in `index.html` or rendering logic in `script.js`.
- Dark/Light mode toggle is built-in (stored in `localStorage`).
